## COOL HACKS

* Open a bugreport on https://github.com/saigkill/latex_curriculum_vitae-dotnet/issues .
* Please use the -u flag when generating the patch as it makes the patch more readable.
* Write a good explanation of what the patch does.
* It is better to use git format-patch command: git format-patch HEAD^

## TRANSLATING
